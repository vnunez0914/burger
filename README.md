# Enjoy a Burger

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the page-- waiting to be devoured. Each burger in the waiting area also has a `EAT IT!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to a read only faded text at the bottom. The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
